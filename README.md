# Probabilistic Data Structures

### Bloom Filter
Implementation of Bloom Filter in python

Bloom filter are used to know whether an element exists or not in a large datasets with high accuracy
Here's the link to my blog if you want to know what bloom filters are - https://apoorvtyagi.tech/bloom-filters

Also notice how in the output image our bloom filter gives the false positive for 'sheep' and how for the rest 80% we got the correct results


### Hyperloglog
Implementation of Hyperloglog in python

Hyperloglog is another probabilistic data structure used to estimate the cardinality of large multisets in O(log(log(n))) Space.

###### P.S. more probabilistic data structures are comming soon
